# RUNNING PART
Task 2.2: read from annotation, create our query and relevance dataset

Task 2.3: build our index

Task 2.5: create baseline

Task 3.1: First try on learn to rank algorithm

Task 3.2: Add more features and test the performance

Task 3.3: add cross encoder as features

Task 3.3.2: add cross encoder cos-sim as features

Task 3.4: add more features: xgbooster

Task 3.5: fine tune the parameters for PL2 and BM25

Task 3.5.1 fine tune manually on random forest and xgbooster

Task 3.6: Add biencoder cosine-similarity as features

Task 3.6.2: add the biencoder similarity to features and replace the cross encoder cos-sim score

Task 3.6.3: Add both cross encoder sim and the sim we just calculated

Task 
# Don't run unless you are interested
Task 1 is mainly focus on data collection

Task 2.4 create cos-sim based on cross-encoder

Task 2.6 visulization part on annotation

Task 3.3.1 create the cos-sim based on corss encoder

Task 3.6.1: process of embedding and creaet the cos-sim score based on biencoder
